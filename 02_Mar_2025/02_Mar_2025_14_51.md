### Purpose
The files indicate that this project is both a learning resource and a development project. The presence of example sketches and extensive documentation suggests it is designed to help users learn how to work with various sensors and implement Kalman filters. At the same time, the configuration and source files indicate active development of firmware for an embedded system. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code reads sensor data from a BMP280 (pressure and altitude) and an MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope) using Adafruit libraries. It initializes the sensors, reads the data in the `loop` function, and applies a Kalman filter to the altitude readings to smooth the data. The filtered altitude is then printed to the Serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 34
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- Number of libraries included: 5
- Number of objects instantiated: 3 (`bmp`, `mpu`, `kalmanFilterLib`)
