### Purpose
The files indicate that the project is both for learning new skills (e.g., implementing and understanding Kalman filters) and building practical applications (e.g., sensor data processing and visualization). The presence of multiple example sketches and extensive documentation suggests an educational component, while the detailed implementation files indicate a focus on practical, real-world applications. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code is for a sensor fusion application using an Adafruit BMP280 barometric pressure sensor and an Adafruit MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope. It employs Kalman filters to smooth the sensor data and combines the readings from both sensors to calculate a more accurate altitude. The code initializes the sensors, reads data from them, applies filtering, and outputs the fused altitude, vertical velocity, and corrected acceleration.

**Statistics:**
- Lines of code: 79
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- Number of variables: 11
- Number of libraries included: 3
