### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor using Adafruit libraries. It employs a SimpleKalmanFilter library to filter the altitude data from the BMP280 sensor and prints the filtered data to the serial monitor.

### Code Statistics:
- **Number of lines:** 34
- **Number of functions:** 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- **Number of classes:** 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- **Number of libraries included:** 5
- **Number of objects created:** 3 (`bmp`, `mpu`, `kalmanFilterLib`)
