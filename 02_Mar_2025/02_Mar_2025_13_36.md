### Purpose
The files indicate that the project is focused on building a functional system for sensor data acquisition and processing, rather than just learning new skills. The presence of multiple libraries, examples, and configuration files suggests a comprehensive project aimed at developing a robust application for sensor interfacing and data visualization. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code demonstrates the use of a Kalman Filter to fuse accelerometer and gyroscope data from an MPU6050 sensor for estimating the pitch angle with reduced drift. It initializes the sensor, reads data, and applies the Kalman Filter for accurate pitch angle estimation, printing the results to the Serial Monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 97
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of comments: 30
- Number of libraries included: 3 (`Wire.h`, `MPU6050.h`, `Kalman.h`)
