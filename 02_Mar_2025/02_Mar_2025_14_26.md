### Project Description
The project appears to be an embedded systems or IoT project involving various sensors (MPU6050, BMP280) and displays (SSD1306). It uses PlatformIO for development and includes multiple libraries for sensor data processing, display interfacing, and communication protocols (I2C, SPI). The project is likely aimed at building a functional system rather than just learning new skills. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 sensor (pressure and altitude) and an MPU6050 sensor (acceleration and gyroscope). It uses a Kalman filter to smooth the altitude readings. The `setup` function initializes the sensors, and the `loop` function continuously reads and processes the sensor data, printing the filtered altitude to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 34
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- Number of libraries included: 5
- Number of sensor objects: 2 (`bmp`, `mpu`)
