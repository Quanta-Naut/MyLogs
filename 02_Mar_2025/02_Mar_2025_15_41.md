### Project Description
This project appears to be related to embedded systems and microcontroller programming, specifically involving sensors, communication protocols (I2C, SPI), and possibly display modules. The presence of files like `Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp`, `Adafruit_MPU6050.cpp`, and various `.ino` files suggests it involves hardware interfacing, likely with Arduino or similar platforms.

### Learning vs. Building
The project appears to be a combination of both learning and building. The presence of numerous example files and detailed documentation suggests it is designed to help users learn how to interface with various sensors and devices. At the same time, the structured organization and comprehensive set of source files indicate it is also a fully-fledged project aimed at building a functional application or library for embedded systems. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor using Adafruit libraries. It filters the altitude readings from the BMP280 sensor with the SimpleKalmanFilter library. The `setup` function initializes the sensors, and the `loop` function continuously reads and processes the sensor data, printing the filtered altitude to the Serial Monitor.

### Code Statistics:
- **Number of lines:** 34
- **Number of functions:** 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- **Number of classes:** 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- **Number of libraries included:** 5
- **Number of sensor events:** 3 (acceleration, gyroscope, temperature)
