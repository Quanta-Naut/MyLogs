### Learning vs. Building Projects
- **Learning New Skills**: Files like `BasicKalmanFilterExample.ino`, `AltitudeKalmanFilterExample.ino`, and `MPU6050.ino` are likely created to learn and demonstrate specific skills such as implementing Kalman filters and interfacing with sensors.
- **Building Projects**: Files like `main.cpp`, `Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp`, and `Adafruit_MPU6050.cpp` indicate ongoing development of more complex projects involving sensor data processing and display management.

These projects collectively aim to enhance skills in embedded systems, sensor interfacing, and data visualization while also contributing to practical applications. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The provided C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor using Adafruit libraries. It filters the altitude data from the BMP280 sensor with the SimpleKalmanFilter library and prints the filtered data to the Serial Monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 34
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `SimpleKalmanFilter`)
- Number of libraries included: 5
- Number of objects created: 3 (`bmp`, `mpu`, `kalmanFilterLib`)
