### Purpose of the Files
These files are part of projects aimed at building and demonstrating the functionality of various sensor and display libraries. They are not just for learning new skills but are also intended to provide reusable components for hardware projects involving sensors and displays. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor. It uses a Kalman filter to estimate altitude based on the sensor readings. The program initializes the sensors, reads and smooths pressure data using a deque, and applies the Kalman filter to estimate the altitude, which is then printed to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- **Lines of Code:** 85
- **Number of Functions:** 4 (`setup`, `getSmoothedPressure`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Libraries:** 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280`, `Adafruit_MPU6050`, `Adafruit_Sensor`)
- **Global Variables:** 14
