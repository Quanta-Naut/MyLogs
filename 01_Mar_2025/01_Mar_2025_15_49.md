### Purpose
The files listed are part of a project aimed at building firmware for an embedded system, likely involving learning new skills related to embedded development, sensor integration, and display handling. The presence of multiple README files, library properties, and example sketches (.ino files) suggests that this project is both a learning tool and a practical implementation. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor. It uses a Kalman filter to estimate altitude based on the sensor readings. The program initializes the sensors, reads pressure, temperature, and altitude data from the BMP280, and accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050. These readings are processed through the Kalman filter to provide a more accurate altitude estimation.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 74
- Number of functions: 3 (`setup`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0 (uses instances of `Adafruit_BMP280` and `Adafruit_MPU6050`)
- Number of libraries included: 4 (`Adafruit_BMP280.h`, `Adafruit_MPU6050.h`, `Adafruit_Sensor.h`, `deque`, `cmath`)
- Number of global variables: 12
