### Purpose
The files indicate that the project is focused on building and testing firmware for embedded systems, particularly using Adafruit sensors and displays. The presence of multiple README.md files and example sketches suggests that the project is both for learning new skills and for developing a functional firmware project. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The provided Arduino sketch interfaces with an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor and a BMP280 barometric pressure and temperature sensor. It initializes these sensors and reads data from them, which is then printed to the Serial Monitor. The `setup` function initializes the serial communication and the sensors, while the `loop` function continuously reads and prints sensor data.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 55
- Number of functions: 2 (`setup`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 2 (`Adafruit_MPU6050`, `Adafruit_BMP280`)
- Number of libraries included: 4 (`Arduino.h`, `Wire.h`, `Adafruit_MPU6050.h`, `Adafruit_Sensor.h`, `Adafruit_BMP280.h`)
- Number of sensor objects: 2 (`mpu`, `bmp`)
