### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code reads pressure data from a BMP280 sensor and smooths the readings using a moving average filter. It initializes the sensor, reads pressure values, and maintains a window of the most recent readings to compute the average. The smoothed pressure values are then printed to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 39
- Number of functions: 3 (`setup`, `getSmoothedPressure`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0 (uses `Adafruit_BMP280` class from the library)
- Number of include directives: 2
- Number of global variables: 3 (`bmp`, `WINDOW_SIZE`, `pressureWindow`)
