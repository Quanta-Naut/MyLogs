### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The provided C++ program for an Arduino reads data from a BMP280 barometric pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope. It uses a Kalman filter to estimate the altitude based on the sensor readings. The code initializes the sensors, reads pressure, temperature, and altitude from the BMP280, and reads acceleration and gyroscope data from the MPU6050. The Kalman filter is applied to smooth the altitude estimation.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 76
- Number of functions: 3 (`setup`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0 (uses external classes from libraries)
- Number of included libraries: 4
- Number of global variables: 13
