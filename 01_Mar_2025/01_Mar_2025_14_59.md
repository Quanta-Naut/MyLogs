### Summary
These files are part of various Adafruit libraries and examples for different hardware components. The primary purpose of these projects is to build and test functionalities of sensors and displays, rather than learning new skills. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 sensor (pressure and temperature) and an MPU6050 sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope). It uses a Kalman filter to estimate altitude from the sensor readings. The `setup` function initializes the sensors, and the `loop` function continuously reads the sensor data, applies the Kalman filter, and prints the results to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 70
- Number of functions: 3 (`setup`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of libraries included: 3
- Number of global variables: 11
