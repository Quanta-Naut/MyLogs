### Purpose
The files in this project are primarily created for building a comprehensive library and example set for Adafruit hardware components. This project is not just for learning new skills but also for providing a robust and reusable codebase for developers working with Adafruit products. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 pressure sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor. It uses a Kalman filter to estimate altitude based on the sensor readings. The program initializes the sensors, reads pressure data, smooths the pressure readings using a deque, and applies the Kalman filter to estimate the altitude. The results are printed to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- Lines of code: 82
- Number of functions: 4 (`setup`, `getSmoothedPressure`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of libraries included: 3 (`Adafruit_BMP280.h`, `Adafruit_MPU6050.h`, `Adafruit_Sensor.h`)
- Number of global variables: 13
