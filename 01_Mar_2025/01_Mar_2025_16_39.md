### Learning vs. Building
These files indicate a mix of learning new skills and building functional projects. The presence of example sketches, library implementations, and comprehensive documentation suggests that these projects are both educational and practical in nature. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The C++ program reads data from a BMP280 sensor (pressure and altitude) and an MPU6050 sensor (acceleration and gyroscopic data). It uses a Kalman filter to estimate altitude more accurately by combining sensor readings. The program initializes the sensors, reads data in a loop, and applies the Kalman filter to estimate and print the altitude to the serial monitor.

**Statistics:**
- **Lines of Code:** 85
- **Number of Functions:** 3 (`setup`, `kalmanFilter`, `loop`)
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Libraries:** 6
- **Global Variables:** 13
