- **Purpose**: To ensure that the Java code works as expected by running automated tests.
- **Project Type**: This file is part of a Java project, possibly a web application, desktop application, or library.
- **Learning or Building**: This file is used for building a project, as it contains tests to validate the code.

#### main.py
- **Description**: This file is likely a Python script that serves as the entry point for a Python application. It usually contains the main logic of the program and may include functions, classes, and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to execute the script.
- **Purpose**: To run the main application logic.
- **Project Type**: This file is part of a Python project, which could be anything from a web application to a data analysis script.
- **Learning or Building**: This file is used for building a project, as it contains the main executable code.

### Project Description
