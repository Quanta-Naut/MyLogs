### File Descriptions

#### micrograd_scratch.ipynb
This is a Jupyter Notebook file. Based on its name, it likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. This file is probably used for educational purposes to learn about the fundamentals of gradient descent and backpropagation in machine learning.

#### makemore_main.ipynb
This is another Jupyter Notebook file. The name suggests that it might be the main notebook for a project named "makemore." This project could involve generating more data or content, possibly using machine learning techniques like generative models. This file likely contains the primary code and documentation for running the main aspects of the project.

#### names.txt
This is a text file that likely contains a list of names. In the context of the "makemore" project, this file might be used as a dataset for training a model to generate new names or for some other form of text processing.

### Project Description
The project appears to be focused on machine learning and data generation. Specifically, it seems to involve:
- **micrograd_scratch.ipynb**: Learning and implementing gradient descent from scratch.
- **makemore_main.ipynb**: Developing a generative model to create new data, possibly names, using machine learning techniques.
- **names.txt**: Serving as a dataset for the generative model.

### Purpose
- **micrograd_scratch.ipynb**: Created to learn new skills related to gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **makemore_main.ipynb**: Building a project that involves generating new data using machine learning.
- **names.txt**: Supporting the "makemore" project by providing a dataset for training the model.

This project combines both learning new skills and building a functional machine learning model. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code reads a list of names from a file, processes them to create bigrams, and visualizes the frequency of character transitions using a heatmap. It then generates new names based on the learned bigram probabilities.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 65
- **Number of Functions**: 0
- **Number of Classes**: 0
- **Number of Imports**: 2 (torch, matplotlib.pyplot)
- **Number of Loops**: 3
