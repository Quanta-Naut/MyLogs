### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
This file is a Jupyter Notebook, typically used for interactive development and data analysis. Based on the name, it likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. This could be part of a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and optimization techniques.

#### `makemore_main.ipynb`
This is another Jupyter Notebook file. The name suggests that it might be related to a project or exercise focused on generating more data or content, possibly using machine learning techniques such as generative models. This could be part of a project aimed at creating new data samples or enhancing existing ones.

#### `names.txt`
This is a text file, which likely contains a list of names. It could be used as a dataset for various purposes, such as training a machine learning model to generate new names, or for other data processing tasks.

### Project Description
The files appear to be part of a project focused on learning and implementing machine learning techniques. The project likely involves:

- **Learning Objectives**: Understanding and implementing gradient descent from scratch (`micrograd_scratch.ipynb`).
- **Practical Application**: Using machine learning models to generate new data or enhance existing data (`makemore_main.ipynb`).
- **Data Handling**: Utilizing a dataset of names (`names.txt`) for training or testing purposes.

### Purpose
These files are created to learn new skills in machine learning and data processing. The use of Jupyter Notebooks suggests an emphasis on interactive learning and experimentation. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The Python script uses PyTorch to analyze and generate names based on bigram probabilities. It processes a dataset of names, calculates and visualizes bigram frequencies with a heatmap, generates new names, and computes the negative log-likelihood of the dataset. Additionally, it trains a simple bigram model using gradient descent to minimize the loss.

**Statistics:**
- **Lines of Code:** 126
- **Number of Functions:** 0
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Imports:** 3
- **Number of Loops:** 6
