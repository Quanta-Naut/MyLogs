### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook likely contains code and explanations for implementing a micro-version of a gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It may include mathematical derivations, code snippets, and visualizations to help understand the gradient descent process.
- **Purpose**: Learning new skills, specifically understanding and implementing gradient descent algorithms.
- **Project**: This file is part of a learning project focused on machine learning and optimization techniques.

#### `makemore.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook probably contains code for a project named "makemore," which could be related to generating more data or creating a generative model. It might include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Purpose**: Building a project, likely related to data generation or machine learning.
- **Project**: This file is part of a project aimed at creating a generative model, possibly for text, images, or other types of data.

#### `names.txt`
- **Description**: This text file likely contains a list of names, which could be used as a dataset for training a model in the `makemore.ipynb` notebook. The names might be used for tasks like name generation, classification, or other machine learning purposes.
- **Purpose**: Supporting file for a project, providing data for training or evaluation.
- **Project**: This file is part of the same project as `makemore.ipynb`, likely used for training a generative model or another machine learning task.

### Project Overview
The project appears to be focused on machine learning, with an emphasis on understanding and implementing fundamental algorithms like gradient descent (`micrograd_scratch.ipynb`) and building generative models (`makemore.ipynb`). The `names.txt` file supports these efforts by providing a dataset for training and evaluation. The project serves both educational purposes and practical implementation of machine learning techniques. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code combines mathematical functions, plotting, and a neural network implementation. It includes basic mathematical operations and plotting a quadratic function using Matplotlib. A `Value` class is defined for automatic differentiation, supporting operations like addition, multiplication, and power. A visualization function using Graphviz is provided to trace computation graphs. The code also implements a simple neural network with `Neuron`, `Layer`, and `MLP` (Multi-Layer Perceptron) classes, and demonstrates training the network on a small dataset.

**Statistics:**
- **Lines of Code:** 227
- **Number of Functions:** 7
- **Number of Classes:** 4
- **Number of Methods:** 20
- **Number of Imports:** 6
