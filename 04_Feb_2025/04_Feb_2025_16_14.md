### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is typically used for educational purposes to understand the fundamentals of gradient descent and backpropagation in machine learning.

#### `makemore_main.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file probably includes the main code for a project named "makemore". It might involve generating new data or content based on an existing dataset, possibly using machine learning techniques like neural networks.

#### `names.txt`
This text file likely contains a list of names, which could be used as a dataset for the "makemore" project. The names might be used for training a model to generate new names or for some other data processing task.

### Project Description
The project appears to be focused on learning and implementing machine learning concepts. The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file suggests that part of the project involves understanding and coding fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch. The `makemore_main.ipynb` and `names.txt` files indicate another part of the project that involves generating new data, possibly names, using machine learning models.

### Purpose
The files are created to learn new skills in machine learning and to build a project that applies these skills. The project serves both educational and practical purposes, helping the user understand core concepts and apply them to a real-world problem. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary
The code reads a list of names from a file, processes them to create a bigram frequency matrix, visualizes this matrix using a heatmap, and generates new names based on the bigram probabilities.
