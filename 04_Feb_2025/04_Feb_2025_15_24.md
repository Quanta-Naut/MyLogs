### File Descriptions

#### micrograd_scratch.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is typically used for educational purposes to understand the basics of gradient descent and backpropagation in neural networks.

#### makemore_main.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file probably includes code and explanations for a project named "makemore". This project might involve generating new content (like text or names) using machine learning models, possibly a character-level language model or a similar generative model.

#### names.txt
This text file likely contains a list of names. It is probably used as a dataset for the "makemore" project to train the generative model to create new names based on the patterns found in the provided names.

### Project Description

#### micrograd
The `micrograd` project is an educational project aimed at learning the fundamentals of gradient descent and backpropagation by implementing them from scratch. This project is typically used to build foundational skills in machine learning and neural networks.

#### makemore
The `makemore` project is likely focused on generating new names or text content using machine learning models. This project involves training a generative model on a dataset of names to produce new, plausible names. It is a practical project aimed at applying machine learning techniques to a real-world problem.

### Purpose

- **micrograd_scratch.ipynb**: Created to learn new skills in gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **makemore_main.ipynb**: Created to build a project that applies machine learning techniques to generate new names.
- **names.txt**: Used as a dataset for the `makemore` project.

These files are part of projects that serve both educational and practical purposes, helping to build and apply machine learning skills. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code reads a list of names from a file and constructs a bigram model to analyze character transitions. It uses PyTorch to create a transition matrix and visualizes it using Matplotlib. The code then generates new names based on the learned bigram probabilities.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 66
- **Number of Functions:** 0
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Imports:** 3 (torch, matplotlib.pyplot, %matplotlib inline)
- **Number of Loops:** 3
