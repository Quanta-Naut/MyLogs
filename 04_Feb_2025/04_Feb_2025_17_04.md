This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is common in machine learning and deep learning projects to create such notebooks to experiment with and understand the underlying mechanics of optimization algorithms.

#### `makemore_main.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file probably contains the main code for a project named "makemore". Given the name, it could be related to generating more data or content, possibly using machine learning techniques like generative models.

#### `names.txt`
This text file likely contains a list of names. It could be used as a dataset for training a model, such as a name generator or a classifier that works with names.

### Project Description
The project appears to be focused on machine learning and deep learning, specifically involving gradient descent optimization and generative models. The presence of `.ipynb` files suggests that the project is exploratory and educational, leveraging Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding and visualization.

### Purpose
The files indicate that the project is both educational and experimental. The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file suggests a focus on learning and understanding gradient descent from scratch, while `makemore_main.ipynb` and `names.txt` suggest building a generative model, possibly for creating new names or similar tasks.

### Summary
- **Educational**: Learning gradient descent and generative models.
- **Project Building**: Implementing and experimenting with machine learning models. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code reads a list of names from a file and processes them to create a bigram model using PyTorch. It calculates the frequency of character pairs (bigrams) and visualizes this data using a heatmap. The code then generates new names based on the bigram probabilities and calculates the log-likelihood of the dataset. Finally, it prepares data for a neural network model to predict the next character in a sequence.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 108
- Number of functions: 0
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of imports: 3
- Number of loops: 5
