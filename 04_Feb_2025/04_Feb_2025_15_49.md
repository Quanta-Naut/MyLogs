### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is common in machine learning and deep learning projects to create such notebooks for educational purposes, demonstrating the fundamental concepts of backpropagation and optimization.

#### `makemore_main.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file probably includes the main code for a project named "makemore". Based on the name, it could be related to generating more data or content, possibly using machine learning techniques like generative models. This notebook might contain the core logic, data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.

#### `names.txt`
This text file likely contains a list of names, which could be used as a dataset for the "makemore" project. For example, it might be used to train a generative model to create new names based on the patterns found in the provided list.

### Project Description

#### Project: Micrograd and Makemore
The project appears to be focused on learning and implementing machine learning concepts. The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file suggests that part of the project involves understanding and building a gradient descent algorithm from scratch, which is a fundamental skill in machine learning. The `makemore_main.ipynb` file indicates a more applied aspect of the project, possibly involving generative models to create new data or content, such as names.

### Purpose
The files suggest that the project serves both educational and practical purposes:
- **Learning New Skills**: The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file is likely created to help understand the basics of gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **Building a Project**: The `makemore_main.ipynb` and `names.txt` files indicate an applied project, possibly involving generative models to create new names, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning techniques.

Overall, the project combines theoretical learning with practical implementation, making it suitable for both educational purposes and real-world applications. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code reads a list of names from a file, processes them to create bigrams, and visualizes the frequency of these bigrams using a heatmap. It also generates new names based on the bigram probabilities using a multinomial distribution.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 64
- **Number of Functions**: 0
- **Number of Classes**: 0
- **Number of Imports**: 2 (torch, matplotlib.pyplot)
- **Number of Loops**: 3
