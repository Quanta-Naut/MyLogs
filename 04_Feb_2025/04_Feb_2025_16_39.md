### File Descriptions

#### micrograd_scratch.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is commonly used for educational purposes to understand the basics of machine learning and optimization techniques.

#### makemore_main.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file probably includes code for a project named "makemore". It might involve generating new data or content based on existing data, possibly using machine learning models like neural networks. This file is likely part of a project aimed at creating or enhancing a generative model.

#### names.txt
This text file likely contains a list of names. It could be used as a dataset for training or testing purposes in the "makemore" project, possibly for generating new names or analyzing name patterns.

### Project Description
The project appears to be focused on machine learning and generative models. The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file suggests that part of the project involves learning and implementing fundamental machine learning concepts from scratch. The `makemore_main.ipynb` file indicates a more advanced application, possibly involving the generation of new data based on existing datasets, such as names listed in `names.txt`.

### Purpose
- **micrograd_scratch.ipynb**: Created to learn new skills in machine learning and optimization.
- **makemore_main.ipynb**: Part of a project to build a generative model.
- **names.txt**: Used as a dataset for the generative model project.

Overall, the files indicate a combination of learning new skills and building a practical machine learning project. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code reads a list of names from a file and processes them to create a bigram model using PyTorch. It calculates the frequency of character pairs (bigrams) and visualizes this data using a heatmap. Additionally, the code generates new names based on the bigram probabilities and calculates the negative log-likelihood of the dataset.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 97
- Number of functions: 0
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of loops: 6
- Number of imports: 2
