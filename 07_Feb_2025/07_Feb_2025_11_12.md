### File Descriptions

#### `micrograd_scratch.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code and explanations for implementing a small-scale gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It is typically used for educational purposes to understand the fundamentals of gradient descent and backpropagation in machine learning.

#### `makemore_main.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook file probably includes code and explanations for a project named "makemore". This project could involve generating new data or content based on existing data, such as text generation using machine learning models like RNNs or Transformers.

#### `names.txt`
This text file likely contains a list of names, which could be used as a dataset for the `makemore_main.ipynb` project. It might be used for training a model to generate new names or for other text processing tasks.

### Project Description

#### Micrograd Project
The `micrograd_scratch.ipynb` file suggests a project focused on learning and implementing the basics of gradient descent and backpropagation. This project is educational and aims to help users understand the core concepts of machine learning algorithms.

#### Makemore Project
The `makemore_main.ipynb` and `names.txt` files indicate a project aimed at generating new content, likely names, using machine learning techniques. This project is more application-oriented and involves building a model to generate new data based on the provided dataset.

### Purpose
- **Micrograd Project**: Created to learn new skills in machine learning, specifically gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **Makemore Project**: Building a project to generate new names or similar content using machine learning models. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code reads a list of names from a file and processes them to create a bigram model for generating new names. It uses PyTorch for tensor operations and Matplotlib for visualization. The bigram model is represented as a transition matrix, optimized using gradient descent in a training loop.

**Statistics:**
- **Lines of Code:** 144
- **Number of Functions:** 0
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Imports:** 3
- **Number of Loops:** 6
