### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code performs mathematical operations, plots a polynomial function, and defines a custom class for automatic differentiation. It uses libraries such as `math`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `graphviz`. The `Value` class supports operations like addition, multiplication, and differentiation using the chain rule, and visualizes the computation graph.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 142
- Number of functions: 8
- Number of classes: 1
- Number of methods in the class: 10
- Number of imports: 4
