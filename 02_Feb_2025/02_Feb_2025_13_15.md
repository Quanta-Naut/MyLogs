### File: `micrograd.py`

#### Description:
`micrograd.py` is likely a Python file that contains the implementation of a small-scale automatic differentiation library. This type of library is used for computing gradients, which are essential for training machine learning models, particularly in the context of neural networks.

#### Project:
This file is part of a project that aims to build a minimalistic gradient-based machine learning library. The project is likely educational in nature, designed to help developers understand the inner workings of automatic differentiation and gradient computation.

#### Purpose:
The project is created to learn new skills, specifically in the areas of automatic differentiation, gradient computation, and the fundamentals of machine learning. By implementing these concepts from scratch, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch operate under the hood.
