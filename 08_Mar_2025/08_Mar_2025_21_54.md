### Learning vs. Building
Based on the file structure and naming conventions, this project appears to be a fully-fledged web application rather than a simple learning exercise. The presence of both frontend and backend components, along with testing and configuration files, suggests that this is a project aimed at building a functional application. 
### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The provided code defines a class `QuickLRU` which implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. This cache has a maximum size and optionally a maximum age for items. It supports basic cache operations such as `get`, `set`, `has`, `delete`, `clear`, and resizing the cache. The cache uses two internal maps to manage the items and evicts the least recently used items when the cache exceeds its maximum size.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 182
- Number of functions: 19
- Number of classes: 1
- Number of methods in the class: 18
- Number of properties in the class: 7
