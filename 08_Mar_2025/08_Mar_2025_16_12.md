### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code defines a class `QuickLRU` that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. The cache has a maximum size and can optionally set a maximum age for cache entries. It evicts the least recently used items when the cache exceeds the maximum size. The class supports various operations such as `get`, `set`, `has`, `peek`, `delete`, `clear`, and `resize`, and provides iterators for keys, values, and entries in both ascending and descending order.

**Statistics:**
- **Number of lines:** 186
- **Number of functions:** 19
- **Number of classes:** 1
- **Number of methods:** 18
- **Number of properties:** 8
