# Tarun's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Sunday, December 29, 2024 at 10:02:48 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Description
This project appears to be a machine learning project focused on classification tasks, likely related to a competition or a learning exercise involving various machine learning models. The presence of `.pkl` files suggests that different models have been trained and saved for later use. The `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv` files indicate that this might be a Kaggle competition project, possibly the Titanic dataset.

### Learning vs. Building
Based on the file names and their purposes, this project seems to be a combination of both learning and building. The presence of multiple machine learning models suggests that the user is experimenting with different algorithms to understand their performance, which is a learning activity. However, the structured approach and the presence of a main script (`main.py`) indicate that the user is also building a comprehensive machine learning project. 
### Project Description:
