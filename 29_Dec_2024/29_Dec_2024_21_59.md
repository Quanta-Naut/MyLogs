### Project Description
This project appears to be a machine learning project focused on classification algorithms. The goal is likely to compare the performance of various machine learning models on a given dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### File Descriptions

#### WorkspaceSummary.md
- **Purpose**: This file likely contains a summary of the workspace, including the structure of the project, descriptions of the files, and possibly instructions on how to run the project.
- **Type**: Documentation
- **Usage**: Provides an overview and helps in understanding the project structure.

#### data_preprossecing.ipynb
- **Purpose**: This Jupyter Notebook file is used for data preprocessing. It likely includes steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Type**: Code
- **Usage**: Prepares the dataset for training machine learning models.

#### main.py
- **Purpose**: This Python script is likely the main entry point for the project. It may include code to load data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
- **Type**: Code
- **Usage**: Executes the main workflow of the project.

#### train.csv, test.csv, gender_submission.csv
- **Purpose**: These CSV files are datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models. `gender_submission.csv` might be a sample submission file for a competition.
- **Type**: Data
- **Usage**: Provides the data needed for model training and evaluation.

#### support_vector_machine.pkl, random_forest.pkl, neural_network_(mlp).pkl, naive_bayes.pkl, logistic_regression.pkl, k-nearest_neighbors.pkl, gradient_boosting.pkl, decision_tree.pkl
- **Purpose**: These files are serialized machine learning models saved using the pickle format. Each file represents a different machine learning algorithm.
- **Type**: Model
- **Usage**: Stores trained models for later use or evaluation.
