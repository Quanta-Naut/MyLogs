### Project Description
This project appears to be a machine learning project focused on classification algorithms. The goal is likely to compare the performance of various machine learning models on a given dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### File Descriptions

#### WorkspaceSummary.md
This file is likely a markdown document summarizing the workspace setup, project structure, and possibly the steps taken or to be taken in the project. It serves as a guide for anyone working on or reviewing the project.

#### data_preprossecing.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file is used for data preprocessing. It likely contains code for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for model training.

#### support_vector_machine.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It contains the trained SVM model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### random_forest.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Random Forest classifier. It contains the trained Random Forest model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### neural_network_(mlp).pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. It contains the trained MLP model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### naive_bayes.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Naive Bayes classifier. It contains the trained Naive Bayes model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### logistic_regression.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Logistic Regression model. It contains the trained Logistic Regression model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### k-nearest_neighbors.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. It contains the trained KNN model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### gradient_boosting.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Gradient Boosting classifier. It contains the trained Gradient Boosting model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### decision_tree.pkl
This file is a serialized model file for a Decision Tree classifier. It contains the trained Decision Tree model which can be loaded and used for predictions.

#### main.py
This Python script is likely the main entry point for the project. It could be used to run the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

#### train.csv
This CSV file contains the training dataset used to train the machine learning models.

#### test.csv
This CSV file contains the test dataset used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

#### gender_submission.csv
This CSV file might be related to a specific competition or dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It likely contains sample submission data for gender-based predictions.

### Purpose
The files indicate that this project is focused on building and evaluating machine learning models. It is likely created to build a project rather than just to learn a new skill, given the variety of models and the structured approach to data preprocessing and model evaluation.
