### File Descriptions

#### WorkspaceSummary.md
- **Purpose**: This file typically contains a summary of the workspace, including the structure of the project, key files, and their purposes. It may also include instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- **Project Role**: Documentation
- **Learning or Building**: Building a project

#### main.py
- **Purpose**: This is likely the main script that orchestrates the workflow of the project. It may include code to load data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.
- **Project Role**: Core script
- **Learning or Building**: Building a project

#### data_preprossecing.ipynb
- **Purpose**: This Jupyter Notebook is likely used for data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Project Role**: Data preprocessing
- **Learning or Building**: Building a project

#### support_vector_machine.pkl, random_forest.pkl, neural_network_(mlp).pkl, naive_bayes.pkl, logistic_regression.pkl, k-nearest_neighbors.pkl, gradient_boosting.pkl, decision_tree.pkl
- **Purpose**: These files are serialized models saved using Python's `pickle` module. Each file represents a trained machine learning model.
- **Project Role**: Model storage
- **Learning or Building**: Building a project

#### train.csv, test.csv, gender_submission.csv
- **Purpose**: These CSV files are likely datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models. `train.csv` is used for training, `test.csv` for testing, and `gender_submission.csv` might be a sample submission file for a competition.
- **Project Role**: Data
- **Learning or Building**: Building a project

### Irrelevant Files
- **Report.pdf**: Likely a report document, not directly related to coding.
- **ASSIGN 1.docx**: Likely an assignment document, not directly related to coding.
