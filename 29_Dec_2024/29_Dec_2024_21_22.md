### Learning vs. Building
This project is primarily focused on building a machine learning project. The presence of multiple serialized models and data preprocessing scripts indicates that the project aims to implement and compare various machine learning algorithms on a specific dataset. However, it also serves as a learning experience, as working on such projects helps in understanding and applying different machine learning techniques. 
### Project Description:
 The provided code is a machine learning pipeline for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple models. Here are some statistics about the code:

- **Number of lines**: 155
- **Number of functions**: 2 (`load_models_from_folder`, `get_titanic_input`)
- **Number of classes**: 0
- **Number of imports**: 14
- **Number of models trained**: 8 (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP, Naive Bayes)

The code performs the following tasks:
1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Loads and preprocesses the Titanic dataset.
3. Converts categorical variables to numerical.
4. Scales the features.
5. Trains a logistic regression model and evaluates its performance.
6. Compares multiple models and saves them.
7. Provides functions to load models and take user input for predictions.
